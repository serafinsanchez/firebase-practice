Below is a detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD) for a Blog Platform built with Next.js and Firebase. This document is intended to be unambiguous and provide a clear roadmap for the engineering team.

---

## 1. Product Overview

**Objective:**  
Develop a fully functional blog platform where users can register, create, edit, and view blog posts. The platform should be SEO-friendly, scalable, and secure, using Next.js for frontend and server-side rendering (SSR) and Firebase for authentication, real-time database (Firestore), and storage.

## 2. Technical Architecture & Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js (with React)  
  - Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for SEO  
  - Routing (using Next.js pages directory)  
  - API Routes (for secure backend calls)
  
- **Backend & Database:** Firebase  
  - **Authentication:** Firebase Authentication (Email/Password and OAuth providers such as Google)  
  - **Database:** Firebase Firestore for storing blog posts, user data, and comments  
  - **Storage:** Firebase Storage for media (e.g., images uploaded with blog posts)
  
- **Deployment:**  
  - Next.js deployed on Vercel (or a similar platform supporting SSR)  
  - Firebase project for backend services and hosting static assets

- **Other Tools:**  
  - Git for version control  
  - ESLint/Prettier for code quality and formatting  
  - Testing framework (e.g., Jest, React Testing Library)

     - Form fields: Email and Password.  
     - Support for OAuth (e.g., Google Sign-In) via Firebase Auth.
   - **Sign Out:**  
     - Provide a logout button that ends the user session.

2. **Role Management:**
   - Differentiate between regular users and admin users.
   - Admin users have extra privileges (e.g., managing posts, moderating comments).

### B. Blog Post Management (CRUD Operations)

1. **Create Post:**
   - **Form Fields:** Title, Content (rich text or markdown editor), Image upload (optional), Tags, Status (Draft/Published).
   - **Backend:**

     - If an image is uploaded, process and store it in Firebase Storage and save the URL in Firestore.
   - **Validation:**  
     - Ensure required fields are filled and sanitize inputs.

2. **Read/Display Posts:**
   - **Homepage Listing:**  
     - Display a list of published posts with title, excerpt, published date, and a “Read More” link.
     - Optionally implement pagination or infinite scrolling.
   - **Single Post View:**  
     - Display full content of the blog post.
     - Render images, formatted text, and metadata (author, publication date).
   - **SEO Considerations:**  
     - Use SSR with Next.js to generate meta tags (title, description, canonical URL) dynamically based on post data.

3. **Update Post:**
   - **Edit Functionality:**  
     - Allow authors (or admin) to update existing posts.
     - Pre-fill the edit form with existing data and allow changes.
   - **API Integration:**  
     - Use secure API routes to update the post in Firestore.

4. **Delete Post:**
   - **Functionality:**  
     - Allow authors (or admin) to delete posts.
   - **Confirmation:**  
     - Implement a confirmation dialog before deletion.
   - **Backend:**  
     - API route to remove the post from Firestore and any associated media from Firebase Storage.

### C. Comment System

1. **Comment Creation:**
   - **Form:**  
     - Allow authenticated users to submit comments on a post.
     - Fields: Comment text, optional reply-to (for nested comments).
   - **Storage:**  
     - Save comments in Firestore linked to the post ID.
   - **Validation:**  
     - Ensure comment text is not empty and sanitize input.

2. **Comment Display:**
   - Display comments under each post.
   - Support basic nested commenting if replies are enabled.
   - Order comments by creation time (oldest first or newest first based on design).

3. **Comment Moderation:**
   - Admin users can delete or hide inappropriate comments.
   - Optionally, include a “report comment” feature for regular users.

### D. Admin Panel

1. **Dashboard:**
   - Provide an admin dashboard to view:
     - All posts (with filters for published/draft).
     - User accounts.
     - Reported or flagged comments.
2. **Post Management:**
   - Allow admins to edit or delete any post.
3. **User Management:**
   - Optionally include features to manage user roles and ban or restrict users if necessary.
4. **Analytics:**
   - Basic view count or engagement metrics on posts (if required).

   - Optimize for fast load times via SSR and code-splitting.
   - Implement caching strategies where appropriate.

2. **Scalability:**  
   - Use Firebase’s scalable services.
   - Ensure Next.js pages are optimized for high traffic.

3. **Security:**  
   - Secure API routes with Firebase authentication middleware.
   - Validate and sanitize all user inputs.
   - Protect API keys and Firebase configuration with environment variables.

4. **Usability:**  
   - Responsive design for mobile and desktop.
   - Clear error messages and user feedback.

5. **Maintainability:**
